# The Aarhus Red Giants Challenge

This is a collection of stellar structure, evolution, and oscillations calculations made in the framewrok of the Aarhus Red Giants Challenge. 

**The science cases**

All science cases calculated as part of this challenge are described in Science_cases_The_Aarhus_red_giants_challenge.pdf. This document includes the description of the file format and naming convention adopted for evolutionary tracks, interior structure models, and resulting oscillation frequencies.

**The papers**

Papers describing the calculations and main results of the challenge are given below. Please remember to cite them when using our tracks, models, or frequencies

* Paper I: Silva Aguirre et al. 2020
* Paper II: Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 2020
